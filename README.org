A small UI experiment for asynchronous, multi-source, local + remote search using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]].

This package is intended to help improve the full fledged [[https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-web][consult-web]] package, it will be archived after.

Includes a few local and remote sources for testing.  Unavailable sources will turn themselves off automatically.
